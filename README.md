# Animations for LHSS Mathletes Promotional Video
This repository contains the Motion Canvas source code for the animated math scenes featured in my LHSS Mathletes Club Promo Video. These animations were designed to showcase math concepts like algebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, and more in a way that's both elegant and visually engaging.
